# GitPresenter

A command line tool for stepping through git commits like one steps through slides in a PowerPoint -- for git-powered "live" code demos.

## Prerequisites

Node > 22 (although you may get by with 20 version)

## Installation

Clone this repo, `cd` into it, run `setup.sh`.

## Usage

Navigate to the git repo that you want to present, and run:

    gitpresenter

## Dev Notes

During dev, you can use `./dev.mjs` which builds the script (it takes tens of
milliseconds) and then runs it.
